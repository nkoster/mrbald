# yt-subscribers

**Get the number of Youtube subscribers for a specific channel, with a (very) simple shell (bash) script.**

Example:

```
./yt-subscribers https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDZs_ltFFvn0FDHT6kmoXA
```

results in a JSON object like this:

```
{"time":"1548875491","subscribers":"232160","channel":"bald and bankrupt"}
```

Another example:

```
./yt-subscribers https://www.youtube.com/user/hickok45
```

The script "[mrbald](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkoster/yt-subscribers/master/mrbald)" is filled with some examples:

```
./mrbald
{"time":"1549136476","subscribers":"240865","channel":"bald and bankrupt"}
{"time":"1549136478","subscribers":"295342","channel":"Karl Rock"}
{"time":"1549136479","subscribers":"910281","channel":"Георгий Кавказ"}

A graph, generated with rrdtool. From Wed Jan 30 21:14:00 CET 2019 (1548879240) till Fri Feb 1 22:00:02 CET 2019 (1549054802), 5 minute samples, data collected with a cron job:

![Mr Bald ad Karl Rock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkoster/yt-subscribers/master/mrbald.png "Mr Bald and Karl Rock")

The script "[bald-karl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkoster/yt-subscribers/master/bald-karl)" contains the rrdtool stuff to create above graph.

**Warning**

Because of the simplicity of the way I parse the result from wget, and/or, not using any API, this thing is suppose to break easily.

Any layout change that Youtube will push to their web site, can stop the script from working correctly.
